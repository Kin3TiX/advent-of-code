# advent-of-code

Dump of VS2015 projects built for solving Advent of Code challenges.

All code written in C++ using Standard Libraries and STL (C++11).  Should not be any Windows dependencies in here except for day one (in which I hadn't pulled out stdafx.h and targetver.h) and the use of conio.h for _kbhit().  Should be easy enough to remove if looking to port.

More to come.
